# Magic Wizards Rules

## Product and scope
- Product name is **Magic Wizards**.
- A "Wizard" is an expert agent definition with prompt, tool policy, budget, and model routing policy.
- Telegram is the first channel; mobile app channels are added later.

## Multi-tenant non-negotiables
- Every tenant-scoped query must include a `tenant_id` boundary.
- Never leak cross-tenant state, session IDs, memory, MCP configs, or usage data.
- Treat tenant identity resolution as mandatory for all inbound channel events.
- Platform admin overrides must be explicit and auditable.

## Runtime architecture
- Keep wizard execution runtime-agnostic via a `WizardRuntime` abstraction.
- Support multiple providers and model tiers (cheap/standard/premium), with cheap-first routing and explicit escalation.
- Public SaaS flows should not rely on unsafe local CLI bypass-permission execution.

## Safety and compliance
- Never log API keys, tokens, secrets, full prompt content, or raw PII.
- Enforce `maxBudgetUsd` and `maxTurns` on all wizard runs.
- Persist usage events and session outcomes for billing and auditability.
- Use RLS for all new tenant-scoped tables.

## Implementation conventions
- Use TypeScript strict mode and avoid implicit `any`.
- Prefer composable services over monolithic handlers.
- Keep channel-specific formatting isolated from core runtime logic.
- Use deterministic migration names and add indexes for high-cardinality filters.
